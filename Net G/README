A final year project I made called "NET G: A network Monitoring tool". It's a python program created to monitor a network by:
Scanning available devices connected to the network.
Scanning for open ports to output and show the user the open ports that might be vulnerable.
Extracting the operating system fingerprints of a selected device connected to the network.
